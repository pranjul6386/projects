In this project Ive anonymously taken the details of the fb login and password of the user connected to the LAN of which the same server is rumming.



I ve made a dummy facebook on using html/css and it is hosted on localhost server i.e. ip of the current network.
That means anyone connected to the same LAN can access to the facebook login page.
Now if the user login to the dummy facebook.
A new window with the facebook logged in to user account opened.
And the dummy page shows the server overloaded error which is so obvious for any website.
And username and password is saved in the binary file created.
We can access this file later using python file so created.


Every file is created and uploaded here only...

Language used : python, HTML, CSS
python liberary : pickle, flask, selenium-webdriver
